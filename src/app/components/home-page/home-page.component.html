      My name is Oscar Tideman and are currently studying M.sc student in Interaction Technology & Design.
      From different courses i've learned to program in C, Java and JavaScript. In my free time i've been learning
      more JavaScript to hone my skills as a front-end engineer and I also play ALOT of disc golf.
